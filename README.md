## Customer Management System - Technical Challenge

To run the project clone it to your local machine and use `npm start`.

## This project features:

# Adding Customers

# Editing Customers

# Deleting Customers

#Filtering (Searching) Through Customers

- note: this filter IS case sensitive.

## Technologies used:

# Create React App (React 16.9.0)

- Including the use of functional components + hooks.

# Redux + Thunk

# Jest + Enzyme tests on all basic components (in the components folder).

# Styled Components

- using the styled-components package.

## (Unfortunately) Doesn't include:

# Typescript

- I have yet to pick up Typescript, and instead of delaying this challenge to learn it I figured it would be best to submit this as is. I am confident that I could pick up Typescript quickly, and will be looking into it over the next few days. I wanted to make sure I had something to submit quickly so that I didn't miss out on this opportunity.
